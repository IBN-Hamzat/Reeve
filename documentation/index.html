				</a>
				<div>
					<p>Reeve is a Node.js boilerplate framework designed to reduce setup time, and mitigate risk when building scalable web applications.</p>
					<p>Many web applications depend on commonly found, generic functionality. This can include -<br>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>User authentication and account management.</li>
							<li>Payment and subscriptions.</li>
							<li>Routing and page management.</li>
							<li>Internationalization (translations).</li>
							<li>Security.</li>
							<li>Access and usage logging.</li>
							<li>Error reporting.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Reeve aims to provide a robust set of solutions to these areas (and more), so that the focus can return to rapid prototyping and feature delivery.</p>
					<p>Using pre-packaged solutions to common problems found early in the development process, developers can focus on the core features of the product directly, and avoid building secondary functionality that is expected, but not critical of the primary product features.</p>
					<p><b>Why would someone want this?</b><br> Developing a software product is expensive and time-consuming. By using a framework, you can ensure consistency and enforce commonality across multiple products being developed in parallel.</p>
					<p>If you are outsourcing, you can reduce risk by standardizing how a product should be developed and enforcing practices that might not be used if you asked a developer to start from scratch.</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section class="js-section">
				<a name="2.0">
					<h2 class="section__title">2.0 Core Features</h2>
				</a>
				<div>
					<p>Reeve was designed to abstract away a lot of the common functionality found in web applications that doesn't directly contribute to the primary "solution". These features include -</p>
					<p><b>User Accounts:</b> Common utility pages for logging in, registering client accounts, sending emails when a user forgets their password, and verifying email addresses when new accounts are created.</p>
					<p><b>Client Accounts:</b> New user accounts are provisioned under a 'client'. A client is a group of users working together in an organisation. They can share resources and information, and collaborate with each other. The overarching client manages the subscription and payment handling for a group of users.</p>
					<p><b>Client Specific Branding:</b> Each client on the platform can have unique branding, and web address to access their resources. When a user navigates to a client page, they may see the client logo, background and colours specified by the client administrator.</p>
					<p><b>Routing & Page Management:</b> Pages on the platform can be restricted in their presentation, in a variety of ways. The developer can restrict pages to logged in, or unregistered users. They can require users to have a particular feature or role to view a page. Reeve handles the routing and page management to simply this process, and maintain security.</p>
					<p><b>Translations:</b> The email templates, front-end and back-end of the application support multi-language text translations with full i18n support. Clients can define a default language to display on the login page, and users can set a language specific to their account.</p>
					<p><b>Subscription and Payment Gateway:</b> Subscriptions are handled through a Stripe payment processor. When a new client is created, they are automatically placed on a 14 day trial period where they can use the app freely. After this period of time, they need to select a subscription and make ongoing payments to continue accessing the platform.</p>
					<p><b>Feature Restrictions:</b> The internal database and pages supports defining a series of features, and restricting them to certain clients or subscription types. Restrictions can be as granular as blocking objects on a page, to restricting access to entire routes/pages. An example of using this could include providing extra features to a client that is on a better subscription plan.</p>
					<p><b>User Roles:</b> User accounts can be assigned multiple roles which act as granular permissions to perform certain actions, view pages or objects.</p>
					<p><b>Email Sending:</b> Every user has an email address associated with their account, and the platform supports sending emails to them. These messages are structured using a translation-friendly templating system.</p>
					<p><b>Session Management:</b> An in-memory database is used to handle active user sessions for fast and efficient application performance.</p>
					<p><b>Error Reporting:</b> Activites, behaviours and system events throughout the platform can be recorded to external services such as Papertrail, or Sentry.</p>

					</pre>
					<p>A more detailed breakdown and explanation of each of the directories and their purpose can be found below. Compare these directories with the notes below to better understand their purpose.</p>
					<div>
						<p><b>root directory: </b> The root directory contains the node package file for starting node, and a series of configuration and property files. An environment file <i>config.env</i> contains build configuration information. <i>webpack.config.js</i> handles the configuration of webpack, bundling and building the files when node is started. There are also a number of configuration files to
							be used with your code editor for code styling and formatting.</p>
						<p><b>/client/: </b>The client directory contains content that is bundled together during development and served to users. At the root of the directory there is an <i>index.js</i> file, this injects React into the web-browser dom. The <i>app.js</i> file loads the router and other dependencies. The <i>router.js</i> file handles the react routing (using react-router v4) throughout the
							application.</p>
						<p><b>/client/api/: </b>Exported js functions that call the browser 'fetch' function to communicate with the api endpoints on the back-end are stored in this directory.</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/: </b>Common front-end functions that are shared across multiple pages within the client application.</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/components/: </b>A directory for storing common react page elements.</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/components/inputs/: </b>Shared react input elements. Fields, checkboxes and drop-downs. The advantage of using a single field component throughout the application is that you can update once and the changes will be visible everywhere.</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/layouts/: </b>Every page is wrapped in a 'layout' component. This component defines whether a header, navigation bar or sidebar should be visible along with the page content.</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/media/: </b>Visual front-end components (usually SVG's').</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/media/icons/: </b>A central repository of icons used throughout the application front-end.</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/media/icons/flags/: </b>SVG country flags.</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/store/: </b>This directory contains a <i>store.js</i> file which loads the Redux application state store. In the development environment, it also contains code that loads the React and Redux development tools.</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/store/reducers/: </b>All the Redux reducers are stored in this directory. Reducers specify how the Redux application state changes in response to actions that are sent to the store.</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/styles/: </b>A single <i>entry.scss</i> imports styling files (Sass - Syntactically awesome style sheets) from the modules directory. Webpack compiles these files into pure css during development and production. Sass provides a significant number of benefits over writing pure css.</p>
						<p><b>/client/common/styles/modules/: </b>The most significant file in this directory is <i>_bootstrap_variations.scss</i> which specifies the default styling and colours of the bootstrap css framework.</p>
						<p><b>/client/modules/: </b>Pages within the web-application are separated into unique directories and loaded in an asynchronous fashion. If you are creating a new page, most of the content should be stored in a sub-directory within this directory. The first file to be loaded is a <i>index.js</i> file which contains a react-router component. This component handles what should be visible on
							the page.</p>
						<p><b>/client/modules/authentication/: </b>Contains all of the pages and components for authentication. This includes, sign-in, registration, forgot password, reset password and verify email. The react-router component in <i>index.js</i> determines which one of these components should be visible.</p>
						<p><b>/client/modules/authentication/components/: </b>Shared components that are used in a particular page or group of pages, but are unlikely to be required across the whole application, should be stored in a 'components' directory.</p>
						<p><b>/client/modules/billing/: </b>Pages and components for presenting billing and subscription management to the end user.</p>
						<p><b>/client/modules/billing/components/: </b>Shared components that are used in a particular page or group of pages, but are unlikely to be required across the whole application, should be stored in a 'components' directory.</p>
						<p><b>/client/modules/dashboard/: </b>The first page that is presented to a user when they sign-in to an account.</p>
						<p><b>/client/modules/header/: </b>A navigation header that is shared across multiple pages throughout the app. The visibility of the header is determined by its use in the layouts directory '<i>client/common/layouts</i>'.</p>
						<p><b>/client/modules/header/components/: </b>Shared components that are used in a particular page or group of pages, but are unlikely to be required across the whole application, should be stored in a 'components' directory.</p>
						<p><b>/client/modules/profile/: </b>A directory containing pages where users can update their personal information and add a profile picture.</p>
						<p><b>/client/modules/settings/: </b>This directory contains pages for handling client specific settings that are applied to all users within the client account.</p>
						<p><b>/database/: </b> The root database directory contains a series of directories pertaining to building the mysql database. There is a readme file that explains how to run the sql installation scripts.</p>
						<p><b>/database/scripts/: </b>As the product is developed and the underlying database is changed, database scripts containing the changes are included in this directory. Scripts are chronological in order so when new changes are introduced, you only have to run the latest scripts. <br>All scripts used to make database changes should be documented in this directory. <br>Every script records
							an entry
							in the 'executedScripts' database table, so you always know what scripts have already been run on the database.</p>
						<p><b>/database/scripts/compiled/: </b>All individual sql files are compiled into a single script and supplied in this directory. For sake of convenience, if you ever have to build a new database from scratch, you can use the one script. <br>When you add a new sql script to the `scripts` directory, you should also include it in this file.</p>
						<p><b>/distribution/: </b>The only directory that serves static files to users over the internet. When building for production, <i>bundle.js</i> files are created through webpack and stored in this directory. When a user navigates to the correct address, these resources are loaded.</p>
						<p><b>/distribution/images/: </b>This directory is for loading static image files. If you are displaying an image from the server to a user without using a distribution network, the images should all be located within this directory.</p>
						<p><b>/documentation/: </b>Contains reference material for using and developing the product.</p>
						<p><b>/node_modules/: </b>When the node command <i>'node install'</i> is run, third-party dependencies used by Reeve are downloaded from the internet and stored here.</p>
						<p><b>/server/: </b>This directory contains the server specific code that is run on a node js server. The service is initialised via the <i>server.js</i> file. A separate file <i>server.dev.js</i> contains code specific to when the server is running in a development environment.</p>
						<p><b>/server/controller/: </b>The controller supplies and manages the 'routes' used by the server. When a request is sent to a route on the server, a permission check performed by <i>restrictRoutes.js</i> validates the request and passes the action to a function in one of the files in the orchestrator directory.</p>
						<p><b>/server/models/: </b>The sequelize ORM maps to the database through the models directory. Each database mapping is stored in a unique file in this directory and automatically loaded by the server.</p>
						<p><b>/server/orchestrator/: </b>The orchestrator directory is where data manipulation and communication with the database occurs.</p>
						<p><b>/server/services/: </b>Reeve depends on a variety of third-party services. These integrations are stored in separate files in the services directory, and imported via the <i>server.js</i> file located in the root directory.</p>
						<p><b>/server/utilities/: </b>Server specific utility functions. The file <i>restrictRoutes.js</i> handles the security of routes and whether an endpoint is accessible to a user. <i>browserResponseLng.js</i> Loads the accept-language from the request header. This is used for determining the language a response should be returned.</p>
						<p><b>/server/utilities/errors/: </b>Provides a common set of functions for cleanly presenting server errors to the client.</p>
						<p><b>/shared/: </b>The shared directory is used to share code between the client and the server. This is frequently used in translation and validation, where the inputs and outputs on the server are expected to be the same as what is presented on the client. A significant file in this directory is <i>constants.js</i> which provides a central location for static variables, ensuring values
							are not 'hard-coded' into multiple pages.</p>
						<p><b>/shared/translations/: </b>The translations directory contains code that initializes i18next with the correct translation strings. Inside this directory, the file <i>i18n.js</i> loads translation strings from a group of sub-directories. A number of utility functions are also provided in this file, used for displaying translation strings, changing the language and determining the
							currently active language.</p>
						<p><b>/shared/translations/countries/: </b>Country names translated into the language of the translation file.</p>

					<h3 class="section__title">5.1 Node.js & NPM</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Reeve is designed to work with Node v8.0.0 and later. If you don't have Node installed on your system, simply download the <a href="https://nodejs.org/#download">installer</a> direct from the website. You can also install node using bash, or using a package manager such as <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> or <a href="https://pkgsrc.joyent.com/">pkgsrc</a></p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							curl "https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-${VERSION:-$(wget -qO- https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/ | sed -nE 's|.*>node-(.*)\.pkg</a>.*|\1|p')}.pkg" > "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" && sudo installer -store -pkg "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" -target "/"
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>For the convenience of ensuring node is running on the latest version, you can also use a <i>Node Version Manager</i> such as <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tj/n">n</a> to maintain your node installation.</p>
				<p>Once you have successfully installed node, you should be able to run the following commands without any problems.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							$ node --version
							v8.0.0
						</code>
					</pre>

				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							$ npm --version
							6.4.1
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>If you haven't had any issues so far, node and npm should be working correctly. We can now setup Reeve.</p>
				<p>From the directory that you saved/copied Reeve, we want to point our terminal to this directory so that we are working from the root. Usually you would do this as follows.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							cd Reeve
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Run the following command to download our node dependencies from the javascript package manager <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs</a></p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							npm install
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Once the installation is complete, a new directory called <i>node_modules</i> should have been created in the root directory. This contains the node dependencies Reeve is reliant on.</p>
				<p>We can now move on to setting up our sql and in-memory databases.</p>

				</a>
				<p>The MySQL development documentation has a very detailed guide on installing MySQL for various platforms. Please read the following article <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/">Getting Started with MySQL</a>.</p>
				<p>Once you have successfully installed MySQL, you should be able connect to the server using the mysql client through your terminal.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							$ mysql -u root -p
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>If the connection was successful, you should receive a similar welcome message to the one below.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
							Your MySQL connection id is 4
							Server version: 5.7.13 MySQL Community Server (GPL)
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Run the following command in your terminal to see a list of existing databases.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
							+--------------------+
							| Database |
							+--------------------+
							| information_schema |
							| mysql |
							| performance_schema |
							| sys |
							+--------------------+
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>We now want to create a new database which will be used by Reeve.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							mysql> CREATE DATABASE reeve;
							Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>As we will be importing scripts to build our database, we will have a significantly less painful experience using a graphical user interface over the terminal.</p>
				<p>Most of the database management during the development of Reeve was handled by a mac program called <a href="https://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a>. An alternative software product for windows is <a href="https://www.heidisql.com/">HeidiSQL</a>. If you installed MySQL through an installer, it is also quite possible you may have already installed <a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL
						Workbench</a> on your machine.</p>
				<p>Inside the directory <i>database > scripts > compiled</i> there is a single file called <i>compiled.sql</i>. We need to take the entire contents of this file and execute the contained scripts on our sql database.</p>
				<p><img src="images/database.png"></p>
				<p>The database directory also contains each individual script in chronological order since when they were last created. In the future, as new database changes are made, you don't want to have to rebuild the database from scratch, you only have to run the latest scripts that are yet to be installed.</p>
				<p>Once our database is successfully built, we can now point Reeve to our database.</p>
				<p>From the Reeve root directory, open the file called <i>config.env</i>. This file contains all the environmental variables used by the server. Populate the following section of the file with the details of the MySQL server you just created -</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							# MySQL Database
							DB_HOST=localhost

							DB_POOL_MAX=10
							DB_POOL_ACQUIRE=30000
							DB_POOL_IDLE=10000
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Reeve should now be successfully interfacing with our MySQL database. We can now move on to setting up a Redis in-memory database to handle session management.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="js-section">
				<a name="5.3">
					<h3 class="section__title">5.3 Running Redis</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Redis is an in-memory database used by Reeve to store active user sessions. A user session is semi-permanent information that is required throughout a user interacting with Reeve, from login to logout. On logout this information is cleared.</p>
				<p>To install Redis, read the following official <a href="https://redis.io/topics/quickstart">quick-start guide.</a></p>
				<p>Alternatively, if you are using a unix machine, one of the easiest ways to install Redis is using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (Mac OS) or <a href="http://linuxbrew.sh/">Linuxbrew</a> (Linux), with the command -</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							$ brew install redis
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>To start the Redis server you need to execute the redis-server binary as follows -</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							$ redis-server
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Once these commands have been run, we now need to confirm if the redis-server is working correctly. Run the following command on the redis-cli. You should receive a 'PONG' response.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							$ redis-cli ping
							PONG
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>The final installation procedure involves mapping Reeve to Redis so the two systems can communicate with each other. In the Reeve root directory, open the file <i>config.env</i> and replace the following lines with the Redis database details.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							# Redis Session Store
							R_HOST=127.0.0.1
							R_PORT=6379
							R_PROXY=false
							R_SECRET=redis_secret
							R_SAVE_UNINITIALIZED=false
							R_RESAVE=false
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>By default, the Redis host is 127.0.0.1 and the port is 6379.</p>

				<p>Go to the address <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a> in your web browser to see Reeve successfully loaded on the page.</p>

					<h3 class="section__title">5.5 Build Tools</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Throughout stages of the development lifecycle, it is important that a development environment responds to each stage with unique behaviour that is relevant to the current stage. When in development, you wouldn't expect the server environment to behave the same as it would in production, you probably want access to extra utilities and tools for debugging and testing.</p>
				<p>There are three system environments used by Reeve you may be familiar with. <i>Development</i>, <i>Production</i> and <i>Test</i>. All three environments change a number of settings, and should be used as intended. You wouldn't run a development environment on a production server!.</p>
				<p>You can change the environment setting in the <i>config.env</i> file in the root directory.</p>
				<p>Reeve utilises Webpack, a module bundler that takes javascript files and compiles them into static assets to be loaded by the browser.</p>
				<p>Webpack handles a lot of the code change and settings manipulation when swapping between these environments.</p>
				<p>In the root directory, open the file <i>webpack.config.js</i>.</p>
				<p>Scroll through the code and look for lines such as the following.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							config.build.environment === "development"
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>These checks run code specific to certain environments. In the first function called <i>loadPlugins()</i> there are two stand-out plugins that are loaded on different conditions.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							if (config.build.environment === "development") {
								plugins.push(new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin());
							}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>When in development mode, Webpack loads the HotModuleReplacementPlugin. This plugin provides live page-refresh when code changes occur during development. Plugins such as this, you wouldn't expect to be loaded on production.</p>
				<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							if (config.development.analyzeBundle === true) {
								plugins.push(new BundleAnalyzerPlugin());
							}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Inside <i>config.env</i> there is an option to enable analyzeBundle (by default this is false). BundleAnalyzerPlugin is a plugin that performs an analysis of the packages in the bundle.js file and reports on their sizes. This plugin is useful if you are concerned about the size of the client application to be downloaded by the web-browser.</p>
				<p>If you swap the environmental variable to production, webpack minifies the bundle.js file it is producing, strips out comments and debugging related markers, and creates re-distributable bundle.js files in the <i>./distribution</i> directory. This setting is for ensuring that Reeve is in a state where it can securely work in production.</p>
				<p><b>React and Redux Developer Tools</b><br>
					When working with the front-end, there are two useful plugins you may be interested in installing on your machine.</p>
				<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en">React Developer Tools:</a> Adds React debugging tools to the Chrome Developer Tools.</p>

				<p>Both of these tools only work when the <i>development</i> environment mode is set.</p>

			<section class="js-section">
				<a name="5.6">
					<h3 class="section__title">5.6 Server Configuration</h3>
				</a>
				<p>For security reasons, it is never a good idea to "hard-code" private information directly into a code-base. We use environmental variables to pass universal information throughout.</p>
				<p>Within Reeve, at the root directory there is a file called <i>config.env</i>. This file contains a large list of environmental variables for configuring, enabling and disabling features on the platform.</p>
				<p>In the same root directory, the file <i>config.js</i> takes all of the environment variables from <i>config.env</i> and loads them into a static javascript object that can be imported and used across the server.</p>
				<p>You will need to work through the <i>config.env</i> file and determine what properties need to be updated to reflect the desired server configuration.</p>

			<section class="js-section">
				<a name="6.0">
					<h2 class="section__title">6.0 The Client</h2>
				</a>
				<p>Within web-application phraseology, a client is a forward facing application that is visible to the end-user and provides the graphical interface that the user interacts with to communicate with the back-end server.</p>
<p>Thanks to improvements in javascript, web browser engines, and the development of powerful frameworks such as React.js, we can now develop complex web-applications that are functionally similar to their desktop counterparts.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="js-section">
				<a name="6.1">
					<h3 class="section__title">6.1 Overview</h3>
				</a>
				<p>When Reeve is deployed to production, a series of bundle files are generated by the webpack application bundler and stored in an accessible repository from the server. These bundle files contain minified javascript code that are effectively loaded into the web browser and contain the client application the user interacts with to communicate with the back-end server. This follows the client-server relationship model.</p>
<p>While the whole application is written in javascript, the visual front-end of the client application has been developed using react.js, a library for building user interfaces.</p>
<p>Please ensure you have working knowledge of how to use React by reading the following <a href=“https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html”>documentation</a>.</p>
<p>
Inside the ‘client’ directory, react.js is loaded within the <i>index.js</i> file as follows.
</p>
<div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
					<pre class="code code--block">
						<code>
							ReactDOM.render(
	<Provider store={store}>
		<I18nextProvider i18n={i18next}>
			<Fragment>
				<Notifications />
				<App />
				<ReactTooltip />
			</Fragment>
		</I18nextProvider>
	</Provider>,
	document.getElementById("app")
);
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
<p>Not only does the index file load the ReactDOM, it also initializes a number of key components the client is dependent upon. The first is <i>Provider store={store}</i>; which is the redux store for handling the application state. The component <i>I18nextProvider</i> supplies language translation of strings across the entire application.</p>
<p>
From within the <i>app.js</i> file, during the ‘componentDidMount’ stage, a function called ‘this.browserVersionCheck()’ is executed. If the user has loaded Reeve into an old or incompatible web-browser, a permanent alert at the top of the screen will be visible recommending them to upgrade their web browser as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>Once the browser validation is complete, Reeve checks the web-browser local or session storage for a json web token and attempts to authenticate with the server. Regardless of the outcome, once this process is complete and the app knows the login state, React finally renders the page. A react-router component is called which handles what page content to display and whether the user has the necessary security permissions to view the page.</p>
