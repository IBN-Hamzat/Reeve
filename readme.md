### Web application scaffolding for production environments.

Reeve is a boilerplate framework that assists developers in reducing the setup time required to build production-ready scalable web applications.

The project was born out of a desire to solve very common yet frustrating problems when developing new minimum viable products (mvp’s). A large amount of time needs to be invested in building the platform that “hosts” the solution.

Most applications have a consistent set of services they depend upon. User authentication and management, payment and subscriptions, routing, internationalization, security, error reporting, and logging.

Reeve aims to provide a robust set of solutions to these areas so that you can focus your time on solving the problems that will provide you with an mvp faster.
